# docker-ansible

Ansible development environment and also for CI Pipelines.

## About

This image was made to have a common working environment for ansible development and CI pipelines.
The image comes with support for the following:

* [Ansible](www.ansible.com) (With support for VMware, Azure, and AWS)
* [Terraform](www.terraform.com)
* [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Docker](www.docker.com)

This pipeline will keep the two newest builds updated.  Any hot fixes that are pushed will be applied with its own tag.
Terraform will be updated as new builds come out, and I see they need to be updated.

If you have a package that is missing from this image and you think it would be great for others to have also, submit a PR with your requested change!

The images are stored in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jtom38/ansible) and you can pull them down by the tag version.
